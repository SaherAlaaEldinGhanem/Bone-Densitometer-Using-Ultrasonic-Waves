# Bone-Densitometer-Using-Ultrasonic-Waves
Design and Implementation of a Low Cost Bone Densitometer Using Ultrasonic Waves


Osteoporosis is a common disease suffered by millions of people around the world, 
as this disease affects the bones and makes them weak as a result of a gradual 
decrease in the density and mass of these bones, thus leaving the patient 
vulnerable to fractures. Studying Osteoporosis and techniques used to diagnose it, 
we found that there is great exposure to radiation during the diagnostic process, 
hence there is a risk of developing cancer, this is in addition to the high cost of 
purchasing and installing the devices used to measure bone density. Therefore, we 
found that using ultrasound and taking advantage of its properties, especially 
damping, may be the best solution..
